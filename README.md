# Week 5 Challenge

### Additional features:

- Unregistered visitor can only see index page
- Visitor can sign up
- Visitor can log in
- Visitor can log out
- Articles now belong to a specific user, and when they are published we can see the author
- Users can only edit, update or delete their own articles

To see these features consult the user-authentication branch
